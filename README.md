# Project-01-Build-Out-The-Website

Project 01 of Tech Ed 017

REFLECTION:

In this project, I have:

- Utilised <head> , <header> , <footer> , <body> , <main> , <div>, <nav> , <img> with accurate src file paths for <img>
- used id and class selectors in CSS
- used Flex as well as absolute/relative/fixed positioning
- used and demonstrated various CSS styling tools
- implemented an <audio> element with controls and loop functionality
- used <a> elements to create links to different parts of the page using id selectors as well as a 'back to top' link

I was unable to achieve a scrolling effect when using the navbar to navigate to different parts of the page, I was under the impression that the scrolling would happen automatically when using id selectors on the same page but clearly I was wrong, and struggled to find any resources online that explained exactly what I was looking for, and if they did, were clear enough.

I am still unsure as to wether or not my audio autoplays, as it did when using a localhost, however not through github.

One thing that frequently bugged me was the small gaps between each image. As padding and margin for all were set to 0, I was unsure as to why these gaps persisted. I would've much preferred to have no gap so it would feel less like you were scrolling the whole page and more like you were scrolling through images, like a gallery.

I opted to create an image gallery of personal photographs, as I didn't want to rely on images that were hosted over the internet. I am aware I could have just downloaded images and routed to them internally, however I would rather avoid downloading things if I don't need to.

I tried to implement <button> elements, however I found them much more awkward to position, both with absolute/relative etc and flex, as they seem to behave awkwardly. This is definitely something I need to practice more with.
I often find positioning to be a bit confusing and overwhelming, as there are a lot of small factors to keep in mind, as well as a lot of options.

developer.mozilla.org was extremely useful to me, as I used it when researching how to use z-index as well as refreshing my memory on using <audio> elements, which I originally learned to use through Youtube tutorials before starting the course, specifically the Youtube channel "Bro Code"

the audio used is my own, taken from a folder of throwaway demos.
